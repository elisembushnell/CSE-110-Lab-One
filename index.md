# Hi, my name is Elise Bushnell!

I am a **third year** computer science major. This past summer, I had a software engineering internship at **Qualtrics**, so I got to experience what >being in the industry
is like. Here is a [link](https://www.qualtrics.com) to their website. Here is what their [gardens](gardens.jpg) look like. The languages I used this summer were:
- Typescript
- HTML
- CSS
- Angular

My daily routine consisted of:
1. Standup
2. Coding
3. Meeting with my mentor
4. Lunch
5. More coding
6. Maybe some other meetings
   
I completed two projects. The process for these projects included:
- [ ] Create design docs
- [ ] Implement UI
- [ ] Design logic
- [ ] Implement logic
- [ ] Create unit tests
  
```
git push
```
